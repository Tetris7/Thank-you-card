## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned


This project helped me practice and strengthen:

- **Responsive design**: Using media queries to make the grid adapt across devices.  
- **Flexbox**: Combining them to create a clean and balanced layout.  
- **Box shadows and borders**: To highlight cards and create depth.
